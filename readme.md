# Tarot in Vanilla JS

This project will allow me to practice my vanilla javascript asynchronous calls by reaching out to an open API for tarot.

Despite tarot's strong fanbase of mysticism, at the root of it, the cards are only meanings that relate to any human's experiences in life. This data set makes a great meditation tool through loose allusions that the "querent" (or person asking for a reading) can interpret however they choose.
